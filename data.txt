Over time, I gradually made my peace with my thought, especially after seeing the outpouring of support and sympathy for being \"brave\" enough to post about such a taboo subject...  Oh and secondly, I apologize for the wall of text to follow, but this must be discussed thoroughly.\n\nWell, all that I knew about myself has changed.\n\n**I've begun to have new fantasies of having sex with children as young as nine.**\n\n*There.  That's out there in the open for all to see.*  For once, I finally have a real reason for this \"throwaway\" account.  Not to hide behind, but to attempt to distance myself from this side of me.  I don't want this horrid thing contaminating my other self, the one where I'm happy and normal.\n\nI...I don't know myself anymore.  I can't go a minute through the day without feeling dirty and hating myself.  And when I \"use\" though fantasies, I want nothing more than a swift death afterwards.\n\nBut strangely, *that doesn't stop me.*  Even while it's happening, I somehow manage to disconnect those feelings of caution and self-judgment in order to \"enjoy\" the moment...  And then I go right back to loathing myself when it's over.  I'm such an awful person, and this only serves as confirmation.  I hate myself...but it still doesn't stop me from indulging in said fantasies!\n\nI can't believe it's come to this; this is a line I told myself long ago that I'd never cross, not *ever*.  Well, that sacrosanct line has now been crossed.  I've never imagined having sex with a child before.  I've never been *this* horrified and scared of myself.  I've never wanted to kill myself as much as now.\n\nI don't think I'm a true danger to kids.  I'd put a bullet through my head before acting on my hideous thoughts.  *That* is something I would not cross.  I just can't believe I have to draw this kind of line in the sand; this shouldn't be happening to me, I didn't ask to be a monster.\n\nAt this point, I think it's quite clear that I am a pedophile.  I am **NOT**, however, a child molester, and I never will be!  There is a clear distinction between the two that must be recognized; it is unfortunate that the general public conflates the two kinds with each other.  It makes it even harder to seek help; how could I ever talk about this stuff in public when there's a real chance I could end up in jail for simply talking about this with a therapist?!  This is why I must only speak of this stuff on the Internet; at least here, I am anonymous and safe from persecution.  Here, I may talk of this stuff freely, without fear.\n\nFor those of you who managed to read the whole thing, I first thank you for doing so.  If you'd be so kind as to leave your responses below, I'd be delighted to hear the oncoming vitriol and spite, as I expect will be the case.  More seriously, though, I am eager to see your thoughts on this.

I have a diploma in arts which is the only thing I'm good at. Anything else I'm an absolute flop. The main thing is being stuck on this constant loop of getting $200 a fortnight from some restaurant I work at. By the time I try to save I can't because I can't decline things my friends want to do. I hardly go out just to save money. This declines my opportunities to go out and meet people because I have to pay this and that. I live with my parents but also i need a job. Shits all over the place. I sometimes sit by myself by the beach rocks hoping that suicide is the only answer. That swaying from a tree is my only thought. I'm just so depressed and sick of being fucked over. How do I have a girlfriend like this how do I even start a family, I only have 500 dollars in my account. It's like the world doesn't want me to win. That's it. NO ONE WANTS ME TO FUCKING WIN. I'm a scrape pass academic dunce always getting 51 percent.
