    "2": "Hey Reddit. \n\nI hope it doesn\u2019t come off as \u201cattention seeking\u201d but I\u2019ve decided to kill myself. I realize this is weird to post on Reddit but I don\u2019t have any friends in real life to leave a note for, or say goodbye to. At 28, I feel like I have lived enough to reasonably be able to commit suicide and not \u201cmiss\u201d any major milestones in life, I feel like I\u2019m at the perfect age for this decision. I have tried my very best to make my life work. I have an eating disorder which drains me mentally, on top of this I experience extreme highs and lows in my mood. When I am down, I get very stressed and when I get stressed I have horrible obsessive thoughts play in my head over and over and can only get rid of them by self harm. I realize this is not how well adjusted adults behave. I realize I will never be able to be the type of woman I want to be because I cannot focus on my life due to my brain. I cannot afford any treatments (I have looked into it) and have no choices. I feel like this is the kindest thing I can do for myself. \n\nThank you for listening.\n\n",

    "4": "I attempted suicide last night. \nWell, not really attempted, because I didn't go through with it. But still, I was feeling horrible and all that stuff and almost let myself get run over by a Train.\n \nWhat I did before doing that was really pathetic. I posted a picture of myself, sitting on the train rails, on my Instagram story, with the caption \"Goodbye idiots\". I just wanted to say goodbye to my friends. \"Idiots\" because they ignore my calls for help, even if they're really serious, they don't care.\n\nI didn't go through with it because I changed my mind and got too scared, but saw how many friends saw my story and I am kind of sad that nobody even bothered to text me. It's stupid of me to feel sad, I wasn't even looking for attention anyway.\nBut it's sad that the people I care about the most would watch me die without giving a fuck.\nI don't know what to think or what to do. I'm ashamed of myself but am unfairly upset about the fact that nobody really cares.\nI knew that nobody does but it still hurts me so much. Why am I like this. Why is everything like this",

    "6": "I'm okay. I don't know where my life is headed, but I'm okay.\n\nI want to share a story, but I trust nobody in my personal life. I'm still in my young twenties but have grown distant from all of my friends. And my family is extremely dysfunctional, constantly putting me into impossible situations wherein I have to toe a thin line as to not turn away either side.\n\nThat's all very vague. I created this throwaway and thought I'd be able to get some support from somebody by explaining everything. But as I wrote, I realized there were too many details to my story that would make it easy to personally identify me.\n\nSo to simplify, I'm worried. I've always had the backminded feeling of hopelessness and the plans of how I'd go about leaving, but I always saw a silver lining. Day by day, that line fades. \n\nI'd love an anonymous friend to write.\n\n",
    "7": "I feel like a burden to others, and that deep down, everybody is pretending to like me. People are harassing me online and it\u2019s really stressing me out lately. \n\nI\u2019m gay and I want to tell people just so that I can slightly be myself without worry, but I\u2019m also so worries that nobody will accept and I\u2019ll lose the few friends that I have. I\u2019m already socially awkward as it is, I\u2019ll never be able to make new friends for the rest of high school if I lose them. Then I\u2019ll be even more alone.\n\nMy mom died when I was in the 7th grade through a mixture of alcohol and medication, and I\u2019ve for the most part drowned it out of my thoughts, but whenever I get really depressed I think about it again, and I almost feel so guilty as if I made her commit suicide because I was never there for her even when she was struggling. I wish I could go back and support her, but I was a selfish, narcissistic cunt back then and I was too dumb to think about what she could have possibly been going through.\n\nThese thoughts have hit my brother, too, and he cane out depressed a couple months ago. He was forced into therapy, people starting treating him differently, etc. and I don\u2019t want to ever be treated like that if I were to ever tell people about my thoughts. This only isolates me more and I feel as if I will never find anybody who will truly understand and accept me.\n\n",
    "8": "First of all, I'm the guy who's posted a few times before about having sexual thoughts of children using the toilet (read them if that sounds bizarre.)  Over time, I gradually made my peace with my thought, especially after seeing the outpouring of support and sympathy for being \"brave\" enough to post about such a taboo subject...  Oh and secondly, I apologize for the wall of text to follow, but this must be discussed thoroughly.\n\nWell, all that I knew about myself has changed.\n\n**I've begun to have new fantasies of having sex with children as young as nine.**\n\n*There.  That's out there in the open for all to see.*  For once, I finally have a real reason for this \"throwaway\" account.  Not to hide behind, but to attempt to distance myself from this side of me.  I don't want this horrid thing contaminating my other self, the one where I'm happy and normal.\n\nI...I don't know myself anymore.  I can't go a minute through the day without feeling dirty and hating myself.  And when I \"use\" though fantasies, I want nothing more than a swift death afterwards.\n\nBut strangely, *that doesn't stop me.*  Even while it's happening, I somehow manage to disconnect those feelings of caution and self-judgment in order to \"enjoy\" the moment...  And then I go right back to loathing myself when it's over.  I'm such an awful person, and this only serves as confirmation.  I hate myself...but it still doesn't stop me from indulging in said fantasies!\n\nI can't believe it's come to this; this is a line I told myself long ago that I'd never cross, not *ever*.  Well, that sacrosanct line has now been crossed.  I've never imagined having sex with a child before.  I've never been *this* horrified and scared of myself.  I've never wanted to kill myself as much as now.\n\nI don't think I'm a true danger to kids.  I'd put a bullet through my head before acting on my hideous thoughts.  *That* is something I would not cross.  I just can't believe I have to draw this kind of line in the sand; this shouldn't be happening to me, I didn't ask to be a monster.\n\nAt this point, I think it's quite clear that I am a pedophile.  I am **NOT**, however, a child molester, and I never will be!  There is a clear distinction between the two that must be recognized; it is unfortunate that the general public conflates the two kinds with each other.  It makes it even harder to seek help; how could I ever talk about this stuff in public when there's a real chance I could end up in jail for simply talking about this with a therapist?!  This is why I must only speak of this stuff on the Internet; at least here, I am anonymous and safe from persecution.  Here, I may talk of this stuff freely, without fear.\n\nFor those of you who managed to read the whole thing, I first thank you for doing so.  If you'd be so kind as to leave your responses below, I'd be delighted to hear the oncoming vitriol and spite, as I expect will be the case.  More seriously, though, I am eager to see your thoughts on this.  You don't have to support me or even sympathize with my pain; all I ask for is kindness.\n\nEdit: words and sentence restructuring.",

I look so deformed and ugly that I wish I could just wear a paper bag all the time. I'll be in class and I'll cover my face or wear sunglasses indoors to hide it \n\nI'm literally ugly. And people are always like \"so what ugly people can still be happy\" but I don't want to be ugly. I'm tired of it. I'd rather be dead than ugly and it only adds to the reasons why I want to kill myself. ",

The only time I'm not thinking about how and when I'm going to kill myself is while I'm watching Youtube videos and spaced out. \n\nThis is fucking torture.

    "13": "I'm sorry if this isn't very coherent I am not feeling well.\n\nI am so unhappy, I can't stand it. I want to kill myself because I cannot deal with this pain anymore. I have kept myself alive for so long because I want to spare my family from suffering. Throughout this time I have tried so hard to make things better for myself and turn things around but I just want it to end. It physically hurts my chest to be alive.\n\nI have been depressed since I was 11 years old. I have slept on this decision for nine years now please don't try to tell me it will get better. \n\nI won't write out my story from the very beginning because I don't have the energy but in September 2016 I thought things were finally working out for me. I had just began university - a chance to start again, put all the friendless years of unluckiness and abuse behind me. A highly ranked university I had worked hard to get into, a course that would lead to a career that I really wanted to pursue. I had counted and lived for this change for so long, the prospect of things getting better.\n\nTurns out depression can't always be healed with life changes. I completely wasted first year, my parents essentially funded for me to rot in bed in a different location, often too depressed to eat or wash, let alone attend. Too tired to fake happiness over the phone, I stopped keeping in contact with my parents and even now writing this, my relationship with them both is severely damaged and almost non existent. They are hurt and think I wanted this, and it kills me inside.\n\nFast forward a few months at uni I made a friend. We became best friends and she was the one person that kept me going; we were going to make it through uni together. She was such a kind, loyal genuine friend, and would always manage to cheer me up. Summer 2017 we went on holiday together and on that holiday she died suddenly and unexpectedly. I saw all the attempts to revive her but she didn't make it. The first real friend I have ever had. \n\nI have now dropped out of uni for a year just like I have done with every other educational institution I have ever been in because I am a complete failure. The organisation I planned to graduate with and build a career in will not even exist by the time I graduate.\n\nAll the people on this sub that think that having a significant other is the answer, are wrong. I met my boyfriend online in the comments section of a post on depression and we met up at university for the first time. I love him more than anything but I know that I use up so much of his time, energy and patience, always taking more away than ever giving him and it's not sustainable. I don't deserve to be with him. I have nothing to offer physically or mentally, and am constantly consumed with mental illness; a burden is an understatement. \nWhen I see couples on the street, it makes me feel so guilty; seeing partners happy and holding eachother up like scaffolding. He is more like a carer than a boyfriend, he would be much happier with someone else.\nHe's doing really well - applied for an internship to work with a large multinational company as a longshot. He got an interview and the conditions mean he will have to move abroad and will likely be taken on permanently there, after. I am so pleased and proud, and I really don't want to stop him.\nLike every friendship i have had, I am faced with an expiry date. I regret all the times I was too sad to be any shape of human with him and I wish i'd had known it was a privilege to spend time with him.\n\nI am a nobody and a nothing. I have no confidence or self esteem or skills. I have no future and am in the same place I was years ago, whilst everyone around me is growing onwards and upwards; living. I do not understand how anyone would want to live in such a nasty world, or how people function or get out of bed in the morning.\nI'm not living. I exist to pass the time before my body will allow me to fall asleep again. I'm tired of being tired all the time, tired of trying countless medications, therapy even costly experimental treatments for nothing to work for me. Too ill to engage with therapy. What's the point continuing an existence like that? I'm a wasted life and i wish I could give it to someone else.\nI have no support system, no friends (and never have) no one cares and the government don't give a shit about mental health. Think it's pretty clear that I would be better off dead.\n\nI am 20 years old and the thought of going on for another 50 or so is soul destroying. For now, im working in a monotonous low wage job to pay back the money I owe, and am distancing myself from people; waiting for a point where theres no one left and I can disappear quietly. I havent messaged my boyfriend for 2 days so far (in contrast we usually text multiple times an hour).\nI have lived my life and now I want it to end. Life with mental illness is not a life.\n\nThanks for reading.",

I don't care if my life gets better, in fact it's pretty great right now, and no matter how much better it gets it won't make a difference.

I used to be pretty good at hiding all that, but it's getting harder by the day. Not to say my life is hard, it definitely isn't.

I\u2019m so, so, so tired of this. I\u2019m only 16 and I know that compared to so many people I really live a privileged life. I have parents who love me, but I really can\u2019t do this much longer. I\u2019ve been on meds and in therapy for depression, anxiety, phobias, and bpd for coming up two years and I\u2019m just not getting better. I know people say it takes time but my issues aren\u2019t because something bad happened to me, they\u2019ve been inherited. I come from a family full of depressed people, I lost my granddad to suicide and my dad\u2019s in recovery but I know that it isn\u2019t something that\u2019s ever going to be fixed. It\u2019s as much a part of me as anything else. When I was six years old I told my mum I knew I wasn\u2019t going to die of old age, and I didn\u2019t understand why she looked upset and told me not to say things like that. I still believe it. I\u2019ve always known I\u2019m going to kill myself someday, and now I\u2019m coming to terms with the fact it\u2019s going to be very soon. It\u2019s going to absolutely destroy my parents and I hate that but I really truly believe that the heartache I cause them now, being vacant and sad and unreachable is worse. I hate everything about myself. I\u2019ve done enough research on mental illness to know that I\u2019m just experiencing a malfunction of my brain. I know these things, but they\u2019re still happening. It doesn\u2019t make sense. I know that, and it frustrates me. But I really truly want to die. It\u2019s the only thing I care about anymore.
